# 🤖 Chatbot Project

A simple chatbot built using **Python, NLTK, and Scikit-Learn**. This chatbot responds to SQL-related queries using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.

## 📜 Description

This chatbot is designed to answer database-related queries based on a predefined dataset. It processes user input, finds the closest matching question using **machine learning**, and returns the best response.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Supports **SQL-related** queries  
✅ Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for response selection  
✅ Built with **NLTK** for text processing  
✅ Easy-to-use **command-line interface**  
✅ Works with a **custom training dataset**  

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSivaMallikarjun/ChatbotProject.git
cd ChatbotProject
Step 2: Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:)

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas
Step 3: Download NLTK Data
Run this in Python to download required NLTK resources:

python

🛠️ How It Works
Loads Training Data: Reads chatbot_training_data.csv
Processes Input: Converts user input to a numerical vector using TF-IDF
Finds Best Match: Uses cosine similarity to find the closest matching question
Responds: Returns the corresponding SQL answer
📝 To-Do List
 Add a GUI version using Tkinter or Flask
 Implement a web-based chatbot
 Expand training dataset for more queries
